// About me data

  bio: `Hi, I'm Shriyansh Ozarkar — a full-stack developer from Indore, India, who loves turning ideas into real, working digital experiences. I work with the MERN stack — that's MongoDB for managing data, Express.js and Node.js for building the backend logic, and React.js for creating smooth, interactive user interfaces. I also have a solid grip on C and C++, which gave me my start in coding and taught me how to think logically and solve problems from the ground up.

My background in electrical engineering taught me how to approach challenges with a practical mindset, and I've carried that into my work as a developer. Whether I'm building a responsive website or a mobile app, I focus on writing clean code, creating intuitive designs, and always learning something new along the way. For me, tech isn't just a career — it's a passion that keeps me curious and constantly pushing to improve.`,
